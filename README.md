Full Adder using Assign
A full adder is a digital circuit that adds three input bits (A, B, and Cin) and produces two output bits (Sum and Cout). The assign statement is used to assign the output values based on the input values.

Full Adder using Always
A full adder is a digital circuit that adds three input bits (A, B, and Cin) and produces two output bits (Sum and Cout). The always block is used to describe the combinational logic of the full adder.

10 Bit counter
A 10-bit counter increments its value by 1 on each clock cycle, resetting to 0 when the reset signal is high, and can be implemented using either an assign statement for combinational logic or an always block for clock-driven sequential logic.
